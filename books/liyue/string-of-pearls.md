# String of Pearls

## Act I: Of Fish And Water

Male Role: Fan Jie  
Female Role: Zixin  
Comic Role: Grandma Zhang  

**Scene I**

(Enter Zixin wearing blue clothes)  
(Aloud)  
Zixin: "The tide reflects the mountains low, a light breeze nurtures reefs below."  
(Aside)  
Zixin: "I am a fisherman's daughter, I grew up by the dock. This year I am sixteen years old."  
Zixin: "My parents are old now. What choice do I have but to take up the oar myself? It would seem I am fated for a
life on the ocean."  
(Dongtang, lento, innig)  
Zixin: "With sail rope in hand, I cast a net among the free-swimming fish. It is with their trade that I shall sustain
my family."  
(Zixin casts out the net and brings it back in)  
(Dongtang, appassionato)  
Zixin: "It is hard every day under the sun, moon, and stars. The rich live fitfully whilst the poor must struggle. This
is the way of things."  
Zixin: "I too am envious of the wealthy women's splendor, though I have never pitied myself, even with but a single
string of pearls on my wrist."  
Zixin: "I have nothing to show for myself but bare walls. All I have is what I make with my own hands."  
(Zixin ties her boat to the wharf and jumps to the shore)  
(Dongtang, senza misura)  
Zixin: "It's time to go on the streets and sell fish."  
(Exit Zixin)  

**Scene II**

(Enter Zixin carrying a hand-basket)  
(Dongtang, straziante)  
Zixin: "Fresh fish, fresh fish! Buy it here, buy it now!"  
(Enter Grandma Zhang carrying a flower basket)  
(Sprechstimme)  
Grandma Zhang: "Look at those fish (fish wag their tails, spraying Grandma Zhang with water), so fierce! They will make
a tasty soup!"  
Grandma Zhang: "All soaked like that, from head to hips, don't I look like a young lady with pink cheeks and vermilion
lips?"  
(Aside)  
Zixin: "What do they call you, granny?"  
Grandma Zhang: "You can call me Grandma Zhang. I sell flowers on this street."  
Grandma Zhang: "Deary, such a soft-spoken girl like you won't sell a fish before the sky turns dark."  
Grandma Zhang: "You might be beautiful, but if you're too shy to raise your voice, you won't be able to fill your
stomach."  
(Zixin lowers her head)  
(Aside)  
Zixin: "You're so funny, granny."  
Zixin: "Oh no... Where..."  
Grandma Zhang: "What happened?"  
Zixin: "My string of pearls, I never take it off my wrist. But it's gone. How could that be?"  
(Enter Fan Jie, dressed in colorful stage clothing and holding the string of pearls)  
(Dongtang, andante calmo)  
Fan Jie: "Like a golden crow that utters the truth beyond the waves blue, I went for a stroll and a string of pearls
appeared in my view."  
(Aside)  
Fan Jie: "My name's Fan Jie, at your service. I make a living doing odd jobs in the docks. My brothers here selected
me as their leader."  
Fan Jie: "The string of pearls I picked up today must belong to that lady."  
Fan Jie: "I intend to return it to its rightful owner, though I don't want to be falsely accused of any indecent act."  
Fan Jie: "Perhaps I shall see if there are any marks of wearing the pearls on her wrist."  
(Dongtang, 12-bar prelude, irato)  
Fan Jie: "In scorching sun and steaming breeze, does selling fish come with ease?"  
Zixin: "My fish are fresh, that I guarantee. Boil them or fry, the choice belongs to thee."  
Fan Jie: "Those fish are as fierce as a tiger, they won't stop moving even for a second."  
Fan Jie: "Would you step forward and introduce yourself?"  
(Zixin steps forward)  
Fan Jie: "It's only fitting that these beautiful pearls belong to a fair lady of equal beauty."  
(Dongtang, appassionato)  
Zixin: "My heart is telling me that this man might be a mack, taking pleasure in playing with me, but he won't fool me
with his nonsense."  
Zixin: "I turn around with my apricot eyes wide open and scold him."  
Zixin: "Such a scoundrel like you must have no dignity!"  
(Aside)  
Fan Jie: "No need to get so angry, milady. I just wanted to check if there are marks of wearing the pearls on your
wrist."  
Fan Jie: "It looks like, indeed, you are the rightful owner, milady. Now that the string of pearls is returned to you,
you need not worry anymore."  
Fan Jie: "My name's Fan..."  
(Fan Jie pauses, covers his mouth, and turns to leave. Exit Fan Jie.)  
Fan Jie: "It's time for me to go, ha."  
(Aside)  
Zixin: "Oh hero, please wait..."  
(Dongtang, lento, innig)  
Zixin: "Led by my timid heart, I wronged a righteous man."  
Zixin: "I can't even remember the name of that hero of mine. What should I do to thank him?"  
(Aside)  
Zixin: "How shameful..."  
Grandma Zhang: "But my deary, what is it if not destiny? A fair lady has finally met her noble hero."  

## Act II: The Search for the Gentleman

**Scene I**

(Enter Zixin and Grandma Zhang)  
(Aside)  
Zixin: "I have been depressed of late, and in no wise have I been at peace."  
Zixin: "For I spoke in error 'gainst a hero seeking to do good."  
Zixin: "He sought to return my string of pearls, and I did him no thanks nor ask him his name, but instead upbraided
him most grievously."  
Zixin: "Shamed I am, and do wish to find my benefactor, but amidst this vast harbor, how shall I find him?"  
Grandma Zhang: "As I see it, deary, you need not be sorrowful, nor should you be troubled."  
Zixin: "Oh, granny, why do you say so?"  
Grandma Zhang: "You need only put up a notice, offering Mora up to the one who returns the string of pearls. Will he
not then come forth?"  
(Ganging, andante calmo)  
Zixin: "Thus is it said—"  
Zixin: "As wine turns red peoples' faces, so do riches move many places."  
(Zixin lowers her head and paces)  
Zixin: "I am of a mind to find him with this device, yet I wonder if he should come forthwith."  
(Aside)  
Grandma Zhang: "Come now, do not hesitate. Let us take action."  
Grandma Zhang: "You shall lose little who rely on me."  
(Exeunt Zixin and Grandma Zhang)  

**Scene II**

(Enter Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Er'ma)  
(Sprechstimme)  
Zhang San: "I am Zhang San."  
Li Si: "I, Li Si."  
Wang Er'ma: "And Wang Er'ma I."  
Zhang San: "Hark at that notice! Let me go up, and earn the bounty."  
Li Si: "Shall the officer ask, 'think to do good, do you?'"  
Wang Er'ma: "Hah! A fool is he who would speak true."  
(Aside)  
Zhang San: "Ho, brothers. Are you all bound for that lass Zixin's place, her reward to claim?"  
Li Si: "Indeed."  
Wang Er'ma: "So it is."  
Li Si: "Picked up her headdress also, did you?"  
Wang Er'ma: "No, I'd have sworn it was her earrings."  
Li Si: "Falsehood - t'was the flower upon her head."  
Zhang San: "Fools. Perfume it was!"  
Wang Er'ma: "Ah, however it may be, sure am I that we all know well the score."  
Zhang San: "Ahahah."  
Li Si: "Haha!"  
(Zhang San, Li Si, and Wang Er'ma turn to Zixin)  
Zhang San: "Ah, Zixin, have you my bounty ready? For I, Zhang San, have found your lost perfume!"  
Li Si: "Stand aside, friend, for I have come to return your headdress. The prize is mine, therefore."  
Wang Er'ma: "No, no, no, Wang Er'ma it is who returns your earrings. Mine is the reward."  
Zixin: "You... you lot dizzy me."  
Zixin: "For we have never met, and if I lost my earrings, scents, or headwear, would I not know it?"  
Zhang San: "Why, you must have forgotten it in your hurry at the fish-store. Just give the reward here, do not worry!"  
Li Si: "The Mora, then, and be quick about it!"  
Wang Er'ma: "Or I shall ruin your stall, and your good name."  
Zixin: "Ah... How I have attracted the eye of these worthless scoundrels!"  
Zixin: "Granny, see what trouble your plan has wrought!"  
Grandma Zhang: "Worry not, lass. I shall devise a way to see them off."  
Grandma Zhang: "Hah!"  
(Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Er'ma fall to the ground)  
Grandma Zhang: "I had this lass put up a false bounty to catch such thieves as you!"  
Grandma Zhang: "The items you bring are false — now hand them over."  
Grandma Zhang: "Or else..."  
Zhang San: "Or else what?"  
Grandma Zhang: "Then the headdress made of prize Glaze Lilies, the earrings of fine Noctilucous Jade, and the scents
shipped in from a faraway land...  
Grandma Zhang: "You shall have to pay for them all! Now then, where is the Mora? Give it here!"  
(Grandma Mang pursues Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Er'ma, broom in hand)  
Zhang San: "Ow, ow!"  
Li Si: "Stop hitting us, please! We don't want your Mora anymore!"  
Wang Er'ma: "Now to find that fellow who truly picked her things up to come and own up — sooner rather than late!"  

**Scene III**

(Zhang San brings Fan Jie in)  
(Aside)  
Zhang San: "Why, I have it now. You must be the thief who took the lady's things. My brothers and I took a beating on
your account!"  
Fan Jie: "I, Fan Jie, have ever been upright, and such things as stealing are beneath me. Do not think to accuse me
falsely."  
Zhang San: "Well, aren't you a stubborn one? Dare you go up with me to meet the owner of the lost goods?"  
Fan Jie: "I fear you not. Let us go! Indeed, I should like to see who it is who maligns me."  
(Zhang San and Fan Jie turn to Zixin)  
Zhang San: "Is the proprietor not Zixin? I shall see how you get out of this one!"  
Fan Jie: "Ah! So it is you, then!"  
(Dongtang, appassionato)  
Fan Jie: "This was the lady who was wroth, and no more words came from her mouth."  
(Dongtang, allegro)  
Fan Jie: "Cease deceiving the young woman, for I am Fan Jie, a dock worker."  
Fan Jie: "I have lived frugally and humbly. Whereupon would I steal a lady's makeup?"  
Fan Jie: "You met my honesty with accusations, though I returned the item swiftly as I could."  
(Aside)  
Zixin: "Ah, so this hero is named Fan Jie."  
Zixin: "It is my fault, then, that he should have been tangled up in this business."  
Zixin: "I shall beg his forgiveness shortly — and should he not accept, twice or thrice more shall not be too few."  
(Zixin walks up to apologize to Fan Jie)  
Zixin: "O, hero, indeed we had a misunderstanding before, but..."  
(Fan Jie turns)  
Fan Jie: "Hmph."  
(Zixin smiles and steps forward)  
Zixin: "...I did have some other motive in doing this."  
Zixin: "For you did not leave your name behind when you left, and I wished to repay you but found you not."  
Zixin: "So I decided on this device. It is my fault that such trouble came to you."  
Zixin: "Please, allow me to apologize."  
Fan Jie: "Oh?"  
(Dongtang, lento, innig)  
Fan Jie: "Though I was at first resentful to be maligned, when I calm down to think, I realize it was but a
misunderstanding."  
Fan Jie: "Calm must rule me, lest I speak in error."  
(Aside)  
Fan Jie: "If I may ask you..."  
Fan Jie: "You said earlier that the business from before was a misunderstanding."  
Fan Jie: "You were of a mind to seek the person who returned your string of pearls, and put out that notice, which by
chance snared me wrongly, is that true?"  
Zixin: "It is, and again, I apologize."  
(Fan Jie catches Zixin)  
Fan Jie: "Nay, you need not be so polite. You do me too much honor."  
Fan Jie: "I, too, acted rashly, and put you upon the spot. I, too, must apologize."  
Zixin: "Oh, no, please..."  
(Fan Jie salutes her)  
Zhang San: "What!? What are you doing? So is the Mora to be paid or not?"  
Grandma Zhang: "Oh, shush you. This is their tale — what business is it of yours?"  
Grandma Zhang: "See, all the ladies and gentlemen in the audience are here to see a show by Yun Jin. and they have no
time for your nonsense."  
Grandma Zhang: "Open your eyes and see, and stand aside there."  
(Exeunt, Grandma Zhang dragging Zhang San)  
Zixin: "Come to think of it, I sell fish here every day. How is it, then, that I have never seen you?"  
Fan Jie: "I pass this way each day to work."  
Fan Jie: "Perhaps I was lost amid the throng. But perchance we may meet tomorrow..."  
Zixin: "So it is... May we meet then."

(Aside)  
Fan Jie: "Is that Ms. Zixin I see?"  
Zixin: "Indeed it is! Is that you, Fan Jie?"  
(Dongtang, senza misura)  
Fan Jie: "I dreamt of you fair last night."  
Zixin: "I regretted our parting, though we meet again soon."

(Exit Zixin)

(Enter the playboy Wu Wang, open-collared and dressed in green, with his companions Wu Yi and Wu Er)  
(Aloud)  
Wu Wang: "I am the great Wu Wang, master of these streets."  
Wu Wang: "Today I am bored and idle, and thus stroll about looking for sport."  
(Aside)  
Wu Wang: "Wu Yi, Wu Er!"  
(Same aside)  
Both: "Yes, sir?"  
(Aside)  
Wu Wang: "I have a mind to eat something new today. Have you any ideas?"  
Wu Yi: "What about some Golden Shrimp Balls?"  
Wu Wang: "I tire of fine meat and fatty fish. Golden Shrimp Balls seem alright."  
Wu Wang: Wu Er, go hence and find a s tore that sells a serving of those shrimp balls."  
Wu Er: "I will."  
Wu Wang: "Wait. It must be fried to a pure golden sheen, with not a speck of char-black to be found."  
Wu Er: "Without a speck of char-black to be found, yes."  
Wu Wang: "Hold. And they must be of size most equal. Not one shall be larger or smaller than the next.  
Wu Er: "And they shall all be the same size, yes. Do you wish to go over the instructions again?"  
Wu Wang: "No need."  
Wu Er: "Do you have any other requests, sir? Just say the word."  
Wu Er: "And if the store fails to meet your expectations, then let's do as we always do—"  
Wu Yi: "What do we always do?"  
Wu Er: "Not give them any Mora, of course."  
Wu Wang: "No, no, come, look at the fish store yonder. Now there's a beauty more filling than a fine meal."  
(Dongtang, lento, innig)  
Wu Wang: "Let us go up and seek some details as we may... All the better to seize her with."  
(Wu Wang turns to Zixin)  
(Aside)  
Zixin: "Would you like to buy fish, sir?"  
Wu Wang: "Why, of course of course. Which family do you hail from, miss, and where fare your parents?"  
Zixin: "I grew up at the docks. My parents have grown old, and I run the store alone, selling fish to make ends meet."  
Zixin: "Why do you ask, sir?"  
(Turns, sotto voce)  
Wu Wang: "Better still, excellent! She has plighted no troth. If trouble should come of this, no one will save her."  
Wu Wang: "Then miss, have you one you are enamored with?"  
(Zixin lowers her head and says nothing)  
(Dongtang, senza misura)  
Wu Wang: "See, see how she casts down her eyes without speaking. So, then, there is no such person. Evil enters and
masters my thoughts—"  
Wu Wang: "Come, friends, take her hence — let us not waste precious time or beauty."  
(Exeunt Wu Wang, Wu Yi, and Wu Er, taking Zixin with them)  

**Scene III**

(Enter Grandma Zhang)  
(Aside)  
Grandma Zhang: "Now then, ladies and gentlemen, if you have listened oft to Yun Jin's plays and become wise to the ways
of the theater, then you have likely guessed what shall come next."  
Grandma Zhang: "Shall we not now accelerate towards a fight most fierce?"  
Grandma Zhang: ""But afore the hero steps forth, he must by fortune be inspired."  
Grandma Zhang: "When evil beasts run amok, disturbing the lives of the people, or when times and tides are turbulent,
that is when heroes arise."  
Grandma Zhang: "If you should pluck up your courage, your deeds shall be remembered. But if you prove craven..."  
Grandma Zhang: "Who then will remember if you were named Zhang Jie, Wang Jie, or Fan Jie?"  
Grandma Zhang "And what's more, we ordinary folk must show our mettle, and yet leave a tale of rescuing our fair
lady."  
Grandma Zhang: "Let us see how Fan Jie shall act."  
(Enter Fan Jie)  
(Aside)  
Grandma Zhang: "Alas, why have you only arrived now?"  
Grandma Zhang: "Miss Zixin here was just taken by the notorious hooligan, Wu Wang!"  
(Dongtang, allegro)  
Fan Jie: "Ah, alas!"  
Fan Jie: "When I heard her words I was a-fright, but I never thought that catastrophe was so near to me."  
Fan Jie: "This villain burns, steals, and kills as he wills. If I were to go forth..."  
Fan Jie: "I shall in all likelihood, not return."  
(Grandma Zhang tosses the string of pearls to Fan Jie)  
Grandma Zhang: "S-sir Fan, wh-whatever shall we do?"  
(Dongtang, allegro)  
Fan Jie: "As I see these pearls, my resolve hardens-"  
Fan Jie: "How could I surrender a maiden to this villain?"  
Fan Jie: "Pearl-string in hand, I draw my sword in fury — to make contrite that Wu Wang, and have him sue for mercy.

(Fan Jie spurs his horse and heads for Wu Wang's stronghold)

Fan Jie: "A good plan. We go!"  
(Fan Jie leaps over the rear wall, exeunt.)

(Aside)  
Zixin: "Not a light to be seen outside. How is this so dark?"  
Zixin: "Perhaps I should relight this candle—"  
Zixin: "No. Would I not be imperiled if recaptured?"

Zixin: "Yes, so shall it be done."

(Wu Wang awakens)  
(Aside)  
Wu Wang: "Why, that girl is as willful as I, to dare to strike me so."  
Wu Wang: "No one is about. Perhaps they have fled further within."

Wu Wang: "Unless they jumped the wall, how should that maiden escape? Surely not by the gate!"  
(Wu Wang enters the hall)
