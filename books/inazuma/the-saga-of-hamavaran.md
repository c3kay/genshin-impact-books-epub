# The Saga of Hamavaran

## Volume 1

**Foreword**

Thanks to a fruitful new writer recruitment drive and the phenomenal success of the contest "This Novel is Amazing!" we
have received many highly original works from up-and-coming writers all over the world. We would like to take this
opportunity to thank our international writers for supporting Inazuma's light novel industry, and we'd also like to
thank Kanjou Commissioner Hiiragi Shinsuke for his grace and generosity. It is thanks to all of you that we are able to
bring so many outstanding works to the readers of Inazuma here today.

As you all know, prior to the promulgation of the Sakoku Decree, a number of accomplished samurai from various lands
were active in Inazuma. One of them, whose name is Hamavaran, hails from the distant rainforest nation of Sumeru, but
came all the way to the land of the lightning's glow to be an agent of chivalry. Though tales of Hamavaran's deeds were
once buried during the peak of unchanging eternity under Her Excellency the Shogun, they have now been given life anew
thanks to the narrative prowess of a good friend of mine, the budding author, Pursina.

Now, without further ado, please enjoy "The Saga of Hamavaran" at your leisure.

## Volume 2

"It's not the tempest at sea I'm worried about, it's the prospect of deferred graduation..."
This was the thought occupying Hamavaran's mind on his long voyage to Inazuma...

"You're worrying about not getting your thesis finished in time and having to delay your graduation, aren't you?"

The familiar-sounding voice came from outside the cabin.

"Shush... Who are you, anyway!?"

"Who, me? Is that important?"

"Good point. No, you're not that important...".

"Hey..."

...

And so, as the great thunderstorm raged, shaking the seas and heavens alike, Hamavaran began arguing with the quiet
voice from outside the window, while all worries about the storm and fears about not completing the thesis on time paled
into insignificance.

But strangely, when Hamavaran arrived on shore, the owner of the voice that had been arguing back from outside the
window was nowhere to be seen.

"Maybe it was the ghost of a shipwreck victim..."
Hamavaran considered this possibility.

Ghosts are just the Ley Lines' memories of the deceased, Hamavaran reasoned. It's a completely natural phenomenon that
occurs due to resonance between past and present. To be sure, it's highly unusual for this to happen in the middle of
the ocean, but it's by no means impossible.

"Who are you calling a ghost? You're the ghost!"

Hamavaran had finally produced a satisfactory hypothesis to explain
away the symptoms of delirium and had moved onto luggage-collection when the familiar voice piped up once more.

## Volume 3

... "So, you really are a ghost?" "No! I'm not even dead yet!" "But you've never been alive either?" "Um... Yeah, I
guess you could say that..." The talkative young girl, who claimed to be a shikigami, gulped down glutinous-rice dango
with such speed and intensity that Hamavaran began to worry she might choke.

"If I had to explain it, I'd say my situation is more like that of a 'ghost-calling.'" "So like I said, a ghost..."
"Noooo, not that kind of ghost!" One argument later, Hamavaran finally understood that what she called "ghost-calling"
was something roughly equivalent to what in Sumeru is known as "spirit-warding." Both involve signing a pact using one's
real name. The notion that you can command someone when you know their real name is common to many of the world's mystic
traditions, and it highlights a core fear held by humans: the fear of being under someone else's control.

With thoughts thusly wandering, Hamavaran once again began to regret specializing in the much-neglected discipline of
marine biology instead of mysticism... First I have to sail all the way to Inazuma, then I have to go through the living
hell that is a thesis defense... But maybe running into this noisy little thing is a stroke of good luck for me...
