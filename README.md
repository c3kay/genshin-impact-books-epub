The goal of this project is to make the ingame books of Genshin Impact available for offline reading
with e-readers.

Due to the small size of the individual books, they are divided as chapters
and are grouped together by region. The books/chapters of a region are currently unordered and therefore
the reading order might not be meaningful. Texts have been taken from the
[Genshin Impact Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Books).
A few quest-item books have not been included in this collection, due to very short or (imo.)
irrelevant content.

**You can download the compiled EPUB books on the
[release page](https://github.com/c3kay/genshin-impact-books-epub/releases)!**
