The goal of this project is to collect the in-game books of Genshin Impact and make them available
in the EPUB format. Due to the small size of the individual books, they are divided as chapters
and are grouped together by region. The books/chapters of a region are currently unordered and therefore
the reading order might not be meaningful. A few quest-item books have not been included in this
collection, due to very short or (imo.) irrelevant content.

[Pandocs](https://pandocs.org) is used for the export to EPUB. Texts have been taken from the 
[Genshin Impact Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Books).

**You can download the compiled EPUB books on the
[release page](https://github.com/c3kay/genshin-impact-books-epub/releases) of this repository!**
