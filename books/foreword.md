# Foreword {epub:type=foreword}

The goal of this project is to make the ingame books of Genshin Impact available for offline
reading with e-readers.

Due to the small size of the individual books, they are divided as chapters
and are grouped together by region. The books/chapters of a region are currently unordered and
therefore the reading order might not be meaningful. Texts have been taken from the
Genshin Impact Wiki (<https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Books>).
A few quest-item books have not been included in this collection, due to very short or (imo.)
irrelevant content.

New versions and updates of this collection will be available on GitHub:
<https://github.com/c3kay/genshin-impact-books-epub>

*Disclaimer: The content of the books are the property of Cognosphere PTE. LTD. or their
respective owners!*
