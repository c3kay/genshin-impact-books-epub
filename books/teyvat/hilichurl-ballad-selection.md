# Hilichurl Ballad Selection

## Volume 1

A collection of hilichurl poetry compiled by the Mondstadt ecologist Jacob Musk. During the writing of this book, Musk
traveled across the continent to visit every hilichurl tribe, even going so far as to venture deep into hilichurl
settlements and become intimately acquainted with their lives. Musk was praised as the "Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian"
for this book, but it is evident that neither the scholar himself nor the hilichurls were particularly fond of this
honor. Jacob Musk, though enthusiastic about hilichurl studies, loathed to be associated with them even in his late
years.

The first song:

> Mi muhe ye  
> Mi biat ye  
> Biat ye dada  
> Muhe dada  

Quite possibly a battle song sung by the hilichurls before combat. I have observed that when two or more hilichurls are
present, they engage in frenzied brawling after singing this vulgar song.

The second song:  

> Eleka mimi-a-Domu  
> Mita domu-a-dada  
> La-la-la  
> La-la-la  
> Mimi mosi ye mita  

The song is sung by hilichurls as they dance around totem poles.
In my estimation it is some form of tribal hymn. It has an upbeat tone and is usually heard during festivals.

The third song:

> Mi muhe mita nye  
> Mi muhe mita nye  
> Muhe nye  
> Muhe nye  
> Gusha  
> Biat, gusha

A melancholic hilichurl song I heard during an exchange with an elderly samachurl. Although I do not yet understand the
literal meaning of the poem, the overwhelming sense of grief that comes through in the song is enough to captivate the
best poets in my birthplace (despite such praise, I must admit the acrid smells coming from the elderly hilichurls were
just as melancholic, and just as overwhelming).

## Volume 2

The fourth song:

> Celi upa celi  
> Sada shato lata  
> Kuzi unu ya zido  
> Unu dada

A song sung by Samachurls. Judging by the reaction of the chief, the song seems to bear a special philosophical meaning
for the hilichurls. It may appear ridiculous in the mainstream academic circles, and I have no intention of casting
doubt upon well-established views, but I feel obliged to say that the question of whether philosophical discourse truly
exists among the Hilichurls is one that still fascinates me to this day, and may be deserving of further study.

The fifth song:

> Nini movo muhe yoyo  
> Nini movo mimi tomo  
> Lata movo mosi yoyo  
> Celi movo celi yoyo

Much like the people of Mondstadt, the wind-worshiping hilichurl tribes often drink to excess and sing endless songs of
praise to the Anemo Archon. This is a hilichurl ode that is often heard when they are inebriated.

The sixth song:

> Unu, unu  
> Yaya ika kundala!  
> Unu, unu  
> Mita dada ya dala?  
> Unu, unu  
> Kuzi mita dada ye  
> Mita dada-a-mimi

A pious ode that is only sung by hilichurls during sacrifices. When performing this ode, the hilichurls often add
percussion by beating the backsides of the weakest tribe members with planks, creating rhythmic ringing sounds. It must
be quite painful.

The seventh song:

> Mimi movo  
> Mimi sada  
> Mimi domu  
> Domu upa  
> Gusha dada

It appears that many hilichurl tribes share a tradition of exchanging songs around bonfires in the moonlight. This song
is one such bonfire ballad sung by the chief at the end of the night. At the end of the song, the chief shouts "nunu"
three times, which presumably carries the meaning of "sleep."
