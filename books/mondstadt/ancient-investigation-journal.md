# Ancient Investigation Journal

## Volume 1

...The weather remains inclement today. Although the snow and wind are beginning to subside, one is hard-pressed to keep
their eyes open when faced with the occasional gusts that still whip up. Such conditions bring to mind an ancient verse,
where wind and snow are likened by the poet to the lashes of a pale iron sword.

But just as Master Landrich once said, one must press on, no matter the difficulties met along the way. We must return
to Mondstadt bearing great achievements. Only then will I live up to Master Landrich's expectations and bring honor to
my family's name. And only then will the arrogance of those who conspire to rebel be put to rest once and for all.

Based on an inscription, we decided to abandon our original plans of exploring the cellar in the southwestern ruins in
favor of going to a locked secret chamber. According to the inscription text deciphered by Master Eberhart, the chamber
should contain impressive ancient frescoes along with weapons forged from Starsilver. If that's the case, this could
easily be the most significant archaeological discovery in decades.

That's what Master Ingbert said, at least. But somehow my heart still can't forget the companions we lost in the
snowstorm just days before. I sincerely hope that Master Eberhart was right when he said that they were aristocratic
children rigorously trained from childhood, and perfectly capable of making their way back to camp on their own.

We shall soon set off from South Base Camp to delve further into the inner reaches of the ruins. This time, it is
imperative that we closely examine the stability of the ruins before we enter.

## Volume 2

Due to the tragedy that befell us previously, I fear that my prior journal entries are now all but lost. It is most
unfortunate that the investigation notes were lost, but the conditions here are truly dangerous.

Alas, we were unable to budge those great doors. In the end, we returned empty-handed, with no sight of the fresco or
the ancient weapons which Master Ingbert so greatly desired to see. Upon returning to South Base Camp, there was still
no sign of the others who had gone missing in the snowstorm. Although the chance may be a slim one, we can only hope
that they made it down the mountain and are now returning with help and more supplies. It certainly won't be long before
our remaining supplies run out. As cruel as it may seem to say such a thing, the cave-in that occurred just before the
round doors of the secret room not only robbed us of Nick, but also all the food and fuel he was carrying. I had said
that it is imperative we first check the structural integrity of these ruins... I clearly remember telling him that.

Perhaps the streak of unfortunate incidents we've encountered in the past few days has caused me to turn bitter. Or
perhaps this is simply the natural toll such desperate conditions take on people.

The fact that Master Eberhart could maintain a level head even in the face of such adverse conditions only made all the
more admirable. Perhaps this is the true tenacity of a young aristocrat. Master Landrich's judgment seems to have been
well-founded. Even as an illegitimate child, he is quite capable of living up to the role of an aristocrat, more so than
most other aristocrats, in fact.

When the storm eases a little, we will proceed to the cellar in the southwestern ruins as per Eberhart's proposal. Based
on the content of what he deciphered, there may be something very ancient within. The sheer cold of this place has the
peculiar and incomprehensible effect of preserving things the way they are.

We must not let down the companions we lost. ...And more importantly, we must not let Master Landrich down. Otherwise, I
will most likely be facing off against monsters in the gladiatorial arena before too long. Even if I beat the monsters,
I would probably share the fate of Eberhart's slave, and meet my demise at the sword of the red-haired reaper of the
Lawrence Clan...

## Volume 3

Does the history of this place make the scenery look bleaker? Or is the bleakness of the scenery here responsible for
its grim history in the first place? Could it be that I'm only having these thoughts because of all that has happened
during this investigation? Or perhaps I'm starting to lose my wits due to the blood loss and the sheer cold? Whatever
the answer, one thing I'm fairly certain of is that this will be my last journal entry.

In the end, Eberhart's plan failed... In fact, no. I rather think he succeeded. In hindsight, his actions are all too
clear. I'm surprised none of us saw what he was doing... And now I think about it, I fear that the companions we have
been separated from along the way will have already fallen victim to his treachery. The cave-in in front of the secret
room with the round door was surely all part of his plan.

Only at the very end when he led Master Ingbert and me into the cellar in the southwestern ruins and took out his
polearm did I finally understand. His talk of a "lost civilization buried beneath the snow" and "a power descended from
the heavens" were just a means to an end. He knew Ingbert loved the idea of exploration and adventure and used this to
lure him to a deserted place where no one would be able to help him... When all is said and done, this all comes down to
him being an illegitimate child. The polearm is an inelegant weapon, unbecoming of an aristocrat. I wonder if he
secretly trained to use it for the sole purpose of killing his master here, clearing one more obstacle from his path
towards dominion over the clan.

Now I think about it, Master Parsifal's disobedience, love of chivalric play-acting, and eventual departure must surely
have been encouraged by him behind the scenes...

The image of Ingbert being struck by his polearm is one I shall never be able to get out of my head. We all grew up
together. But none of us saw beyond the kind and gentle facade to the monster he was inside. Landrich was already
planning to bestow the clan name upon him after returning from the investigation anyway. Maybe if he'd known of his
plans, things never would have turned out this way... Or perhaps he did already know of his plans, and that was
precisely what prompted him to take this opportunity to move himself one step closer towards the front in the line of
succession...

I am sorry, Priscilla, for I will not make it back to Mondstadt.

Whoever reads this, please warn Landrich. Eberhart is badly injured too, but there is still a chance he will make it
back to Mondstadt. And if that happens... There will only be one more obstacle left for him on his road to revolt.
